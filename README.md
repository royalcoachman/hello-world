# hello-world
First repository

This is me editing the file - signed in using chrome.

Now I'm in the readme-edits branch, I think... editing the file.  
I'm supposed to write something about myself, so here it is:
- I'm a retired computer engineer with an acient degree in EE from U of MO in Columbia.
- (ha! The editor detected the - sign and generated one for me, good!)
- I worked for IBM on its mid-range computers, S/32, S/34, S/36, S/38.
  . Later, the S/38 suffered a number of confusing name changes, AS/400, iSeries and God knows what else.
(nope, it didn't detect the period, too bad )

Now that I'm retired I have been experimenting with Raspberry Pis.  I have two, Pi4 and Pi2.  Both are Raspberry Pi 4's, the first with 4 gbytes of memory and the second with 2 gbytes of memory.  Both are overclocked to 1900 mhz and have aluminum cases that make contact with the processor chip (and others) and are passivly cooled.

Pi4 (the one I'm typing this on) is my 'desktop' system and Pi2 is my 'server' system.  Both use Manjaro Xfce as their OS and I'm using Chromium as the browser.  The server is offering one Share and makes use of Samba to do so.  The hard disk on Pi2 is a 1 TB disk. 

Ok that's enough, now I will commit.
