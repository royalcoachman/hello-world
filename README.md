# hello-world
First repository

This is me editing the file - signed in using chrome.

Now I'm in the readme-edits branch, I think... editing the file.  
I'm supposed to write something about myself, so here it is:
- I'm a retired computer engineer with an acient degree in EE from U of MO in Columbia.
- (ha! The editor detected the - sign and generated one for me, good!)
- I worked for IBM on its mid-range computers, S/32, S/34, S/36, S/38.
  . Later, the S/38 suffered a number of confusing name changes, AS/400, iSeries and God knows what else.
(nope, it didn't detect the period, too bad )

Ok that's enough, now I will commit.
